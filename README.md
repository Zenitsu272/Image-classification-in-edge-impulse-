# Image-classification-in-edge-impulse-
A Machine-Learning based image classification using Edge impulse.
With the world growing in a rapid rate, automating things with AI has helped mankind in a very constructive way.
Here is a simple project which I did using edge impulse which basically classifies my hand signal on the basis of my hand's position.
This primarily has 2 labels, Open hand and Close hand. This model would classify if my hand/images in the dataset are open or closed.
I took this dataset manually using a laptop and based on what i've uploaded, the model classifies the images.
This model has acquired a perfect accuracy which is 100%. Since this is relatively a smaller dataset, the model classified the images with 100% accuracy and its not overfitting.
I'm looking forward for the deployment of this in ESP-32 cam, in which I expect a very good accuracy.
